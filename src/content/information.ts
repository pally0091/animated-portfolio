    "Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Debashis Roy, I know a lot about making websites look good and work well using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've used fancy tools like Bootstrap and TailwindCSS. I'm also good at creating interactive stuff with React and React Router. I'm getting the hang of backend stuff too, like Node.js, Express, and CORS. I've been an IT Technician for 14 years, so I know my way around computersâ€”hardware, software, networks, servers, you name it. I'm confident in fixing all sorts of computer issues, big or small. I'm really into learning new things, especially in technology. Right now, I'm picking up skills in Next.js and TypeScript to level up my web development game. Keeping up with the latest tech is crucial for me, both personally and for my career. I like working with people, being friendly, and helping out wherever I can. Teamwork is key, and I always aim to do my best, no matter what I'm working on.",
